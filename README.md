# This is the project answering the interview questions from LeBaoHuYu.

## To run the code, you should:

1. Clone from github.
2. Open in vscode or any other IDE.
3. Run command `npm install`.
4. Open a web browser, and type `http://localhost:5173/taskProcessor` for task 1 page, or type`http://localhost:5173/mapGenerator` for task 2 page.


## remark

This project uses vite + TypeScript + React + AntD as it's basic dependencies. All vite configs remain default. There's no style or css optimization in the project.

### Task 1

Although I prefer using vanillaJS for better performance, but this could be a rare scenario in developer's daily life. 
I left code base in the utils.ts file in taskProcessor folder for a guideline, and implement all code in the index.js file following the requirements.  

### Task 2

All requirements are fulfilled without further optimizations.
